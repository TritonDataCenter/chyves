This document tracks changes that are made in order to ensure dataset and guests contain the latest structure and syntax. This document is a matter of reference as the process of upgrading has been automated with `chyves dataset <pool> upgrade` and `chyves <guest> upgrade`. While we try to mitigate the need for such a document through planning, this can not always be the case. This can be especially true with new features.
